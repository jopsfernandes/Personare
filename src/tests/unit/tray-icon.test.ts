/**
 * RED phase (Issue #20, Spec Driven TDD): src/main/tray-icon.ts does not
 * exist yet. Every test below is expected to fail until the Developer
 * implements createPlaceholderTrayIcon, per
 * docs/specs/issue-20-notificacao-boot.md AC-2.
 *
 * Approach investigated and chosen: Electron's own `electron` npm package,
 * when required outside of the real Electron binary -- exactly what
 * happens here, under plain Node/Vitest with the jsdom environment (see
 * vitest.config.ts) -- does not expose a working `nativeImage` API; its
 * package.json "main" resolves to the path of the Electron executable
 * instead of the native module. This repo has no lightweight "run this one
 * unit test file inside a real Electron process" harness -- the only thing
 * that launches a real Electron process is the Playwright e2e suite
 * (src/tests/e2e/*, via electron-playwright-helpers), which requires a full
 * packaged build first and targets end-to-end UI flows, not a single pure
 * function. So, mirroring the precedent already established by
 * src/tests/unit/dialog-ipc.test.ts (which mocks electron's `dialog` for
 * the exact same reason), this suite mocks electron's `nativeImage.
 * createFromBuffer` and asserts on what createPlaceholderTrayIcon feeds
 * it: a 32x32 RGBA buffer (4 bytes/pixel) that is genuinely "not empty" --
 * real, opaque pixel data forming a filled circle by distance to center
 * (per AC-2), not an all-zero/fully-transparent buffer -- plus the
 * pass-through of createFromBuffer's return value as the function's own
 * return value.
